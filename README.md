# RaceDay API — Part 2

**Module:** PROG6212/W – Programming 2B
**Part 2 – RESTful API Development**

RaceDay is a full-stack event management platform for South Africa's road
running, walking, and cycling community. This part contains the RESTful API
built with ASP.NET Core Web API and Entity Framework Core (Code-First).

---

## Roles

| Role | What they can do |
|---|---|
| **Organiser** | Create, edit, and delete events; manage categories; view all enrolments for their events; record participant results. |
| **Participant** | Browse events, enrol under a category, view own enrolments, view own race results. |

Role-based access is enforced at the API level using session management.
Organiser endpoints return `403 Forbidden` when called by a Participant, and
vice versa.

## How to run

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 (or VS Code with C# extension)
- .NET 8 SDK
- SQL Server (the same local instance used in Part 1)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repo** and open `RaceDayAPI.sln` in Visual Studio.

2. **Update the connection string** in `RaceDayAPI/appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=RaceDayDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_SERVER_NAME` with the server name shown in SSMS when you
   connect (e.g. `DESKTOP-4BP499D\Prince` or just `localhost`).

3. **Run the project** — press F5 or click the green Run button.
   - EF Core will automatically create and migrate the database on first run.
   - The app opens at the Swagger UI (`https://localhost:{port}/`).

4. **Test the API in Swagger:**
   - Register an Organiser via `POST /api/auth/register`
   - Register a Participant via `POST /api/auth/register`
   - Log in via `POST /api/auth/login` (session cookie is set automatically)
   - Try the protected endpoints — Swagger sends the session cookie for you

### Running the unit tests

In Visual Studio: **Test → Run All Tests**

From the terminal:
```bash
dotnet test RaceDayAPI.sln --verbosity normal
```

All tests use an in-memory database — no SQL Server connection needed.

## CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push.
It restores packages, builds the solution, and runs all unit tests.
